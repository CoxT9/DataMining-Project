This is a repository for COMP 4710 - Introduction to Data Mining. Fall 2017.

This repository captures the work completed for the course project. The project undertaken is "Evaluating strategies for improved accuracy in hurricane trajectory prediction"

Accuracy improvement strategies to be evaluated include:
- Best-Rule-Fit function which accounts for absence of matching rule (closest fit)
- Finer-grained trajectory prediction by partitioning regions using KD-Trees

Project members: Jasmine Bissonnette, Caden Marofke, Taylor Cox

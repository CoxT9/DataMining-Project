The development of an accurate hurricane trajectory prediction model is a problem which has received little attention in the data mining literature. Works including [1] and [2] have been completed to develop data-mining approaches to hurricane intensity prediction. These works however do not describe approaches to hurricane trajectory prediction. Hurricane trajectory prediction has been covered in previous meteoroligical and geographic information system (GIS) works. These types of hurricane trajectory forecasting models include those seen in [3] or [4]. The intersection between data mining and hurricane trajectory prediction is a problem space that has received little recently attention. In __, [5] proposed a clustering-based model for typhoon track prediction based on specific characteristics of historical data. Typhoons are then clustered into groups depending on the general trajectory patterns they exhibit. While this work provided novel results in typhoon track clustering, it is not clear if the proposed solution is able to predict the trajectories of new storms. Additionally, the clusters developed apply specific to typhoons, which are waterborne storms native to the east-pacific seaboard. Such storm patterns may not be applicable to patterns found in hurricanes, which are waterborne storms of the west-atlantic seaboard. For this reason, the proposed clustering patterns of [5] were not used in this work.

The primary baseline of this work is [6], which uses a modified variant of Apriori (first proposed in [7]) to determine frequent hurricane trajectory patterns. These trajectory patterns correspond to interesting trajectory association rules, which are used to train a prediction model. The modification of Apriori used in [6] and used in this work is based on AprioriAll, also first proposed in [7]. AprioriAll transforms a transaction database into a "customer" database, where each entry contains a customer and an ordered sequence of "purchased" items. The ordered sequence database is then mined for frequent ordered patterns, or frequent sequences. The modification of Apriori proposed in [6] mines frequent ordered patterns and thus skips the transformation step of AprioriAll. Therefore, the database provided [6] and in this work is a series of "customers" (hurricanes) with a sequence of "purchases" (recorded coordinates over a specific time interval). The hurricane-trajetory database is mined directly for ordered frequent sequences and interesting trajectory patterns. The database therefore serves as the training data for the model to be developed in this work.

How the paper works:

HTPDM (Motion)

1. Mine historical traj (assoc rule: mtn patterns)
2. Match curr traj to mtn patt
2.1 if none: match prediction according to current mvmt

Data: 1900-2008 atlantic hurricane data

result:
extraps: 57.5%
all scc: 67%

1) data preproc

raw traj (atl):
1900-2000 test
2001-2008 train

continuous pstn: need to discretize

region div into sq areas.
Traj -> Area Sequence

t1 subtraj t2:
	t2 contains t1
